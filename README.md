### Motivation Behind The Project
Imagine your favourite team lost its most important player through a transfer, who are the players that can replace him/her ? who posseses similar XG, XA and similar style of play ? Thats one of the main questions that fans and teams always think about.
A model that can show you the most similar players to your chosen player as rapidly as possible in real time

The goal here is to make a recommendation engine that lets you find players of similar style and stats to a specific selected football player
